# advent-of-code-c
This repo contains my solutions to the 2024 Advent of Code challenge!
This challenge is being done as a way of practicing C programming (all solutions done in C)

(Might also do in Haskell to practice functional but idk :/ )

To compile each file, use:\
    clang -std=c11 -Wall -pedantic -g [file].c -o [file] -fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address

Progress will be updated below as the challenge progresses:\
**Days attempted:** 2/25\
**Days completed:** 2/25\
**Total stars:** 4/50
